Followed and replicated the journal paper: Investigation on sintering mechanism of nanoscale tungsten powder based on atomistic simulation by Amitava Moitra , Sungho Kim , Seong-Gon Kim , Seong Jin Park  , Randall M. German , Mark F. Horstemeyer a  


Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulato(LAMMPS) code was developed to replicate micromechanics based sintering behaviour in order to study and improve process parameters.


Temperature: 0K to 3500K ramped up and equilibriated in a thermal cycle of 500K


Pressure: Ramped up to 0.5 GPa throughout the duration of this project
